##Who we are

The OpenVnmrJ project as a community revolves around OpenVnmrJ as a piece of software. OpenVnmrJ resulted from the open-source release of commercial software for running NMR spectrometers. We are a group of open-source developers and users who develop, use, document, and promote OpenVnmrJ, NMR spectrometers and data stations running OpenVnmrJ, and other related activities for our mutual benefit.

OpenVnmrJ is designed to be very extensible with:
- A rich set of macros, written in MAGICAL
- A very configurable interface, using XML assets
- A comprehensive library of pulse programs, written in C, usually with macros and XML files to ease setting up experiments and processing data
- All these are open sourced and can use help to maintain code, fix bugs, add new features, and improve the user experience for all uses of OpenVnmrJ.

The project is affiliated with Stanford University, which legally owns the project assets.
